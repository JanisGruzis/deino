Installation
==============

These are general and probably like 90% of steps you should use to setup basic environment for running symfony2 project. Enjoy.

OS software
-----------

1. Get dat Ubuntu 14.04
1. Install php. `sudo apt-get install php5`
1. Install mysql. `sudo apt-get install mysql-server`
1. Install multiple user permission manager a.k.a. acl. `sudo apt-get install acl`
1. Install composer. `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/bin`

App setup and dependencies
--------------------------

1. Download repository content. git pull <address> and stuff. If you want, I can add certificate to repository for faster pull/push.
1. Install vendors (php lib dependencies). `composer install`
1. Setup cache, log permissions. `./permissions.sh`
1. Copy app/config/parameters.yml.dist to app/config/parameters.yml and complete with your data.
1. Create mysql db.
1. Check framework dependencies. `php app/check.php` and fix them.

Running
-------

You can run software with apache (which requires vhost setup and stuff, but symfony is cool and has built in php based dev server). For dat sweet sweet server run:

	php app/console server:run
	
Usage
=====

Some general shortcuts for doing stuff.

Update database with changes
----------------------------

If there are changes in model, run.

	php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force

Create entity for ORM
---------------------

You can create entity class and you can also create it interactively through cli.

	php app/console doctrine:generate:entity
	
Create setter/getter methods
----------------------------

If you are lazy as me you can in entities simply write attribute and run command bellow to generate setter/getter methods and repository for it.

	php app/console doctrine:generate:entities AppBundle


Clear cache
-----------

If something doesnt show up (dont use for asset update) use this command.

	php app/console cache:clear

Dump assets
-----------

Assets (js, css e.c.) can be dumped from bundles to web directory on each changes. But in dev environment its possible to view changes in real time.
If you choose not to view realtime changes to dump them use these commands.

	php app/console assets:isntall --symlink    (creates symlinks from bundles to web dir, run once)
	php app/console assetic:dump                (dump assets from symlinks in single file - can be minimized and uglyfied at this step)
